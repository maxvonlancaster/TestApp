Manage packages by using NuGet, NPM and Bower
	Bower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesn’t concatenate or minify code or do 
	anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.
	bower install <package>
