1. Understanding networks: layers and protocols
	Protocol - set of rules that governs the communication between computers on a network. 
	OSI (open system interconnetcion) - defines 7 layers.
	Four main layers in simplification: Physical/data link (Ethernet); Network (IP, Ipx); 
	Transport (Tcp, spx); Session/presentation/application (http, ftp, telnet. smtp, dns).



2. Basic understanding of TCP/IP model and protocols
	


3. Defining internet, intranet and VPN


4. Basics of Firewalls and DMZ


5. Application layer protocols basics (HTTP, FTP, Telnet)


6. Understanding HTTP and WWW


7. Basic troubleshooting tools (ICMP, ping, traceroute)


8. Client/Server model


9. Sockets, IP and port addressing


10. Using proxy server


11. File transfer services: FTP, TFTP


12. Name resolution services: DNS, whois


13. Remote access services: Telnet, SSH, rdesktop, VNC


14. The basic difference between HTTP and HTTPS protocols
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) -> extension of http, used for secure communication over a computer network, widely used on the internet.
	In https the comunication protocol is encrypted using transport level security (tsl) or its predecesor, secure socets layer (ssl). 
	Motivation: authentication of the accessed website, protection of privacy and integrity of data while transaction. Bidirectional encryption.
	Other differences: Port (http: 80, https: 443), Layer: (http: Application, https: Transport)
