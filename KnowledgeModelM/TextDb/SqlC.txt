Sessions, transactions, locks
	A SQL session is an occurrence of a user interacting with a relational database through the use of SQL commands. When a user initially 
	connects to the database, a session is established.
	
	A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. Transactions are units or sequences of work accomplished in a logical 
	order, whether in a manual fashion by a user or automatically by some sort of a database program.
	
	Locking is essential to successful SQL Server transactions processing and it is designed to allow SQL Server to work seamlessly in a multi-
	user environment. Locking is the way that SQL Server manages transaction concurrency.

Implementing stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers
	

Cursors
	A database cursor is an object that enables traversal over the rows of a result set. It allows you to process individual row returned by a query.
