Tables, relationships, keys, constraints understanding
	A table is a collection of related data held in a table format within a database. It consists of columns, and rows.
	Relation, is a set of tuples (d1, d2, ..., dn), where each element dj is a member of Dj, a data domain.
	A DBMS key is an attribute or set of an attribute which helps you to identify a row(tuple) in a relation(table). They allow you to find the 
	relation between two tables. Keys help you uniquely identify a row in a table by a combination of one or more columns in that table.
	Super Key a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table. A Super key may have additional attributes that are not needed 
	for unique identification.
	Primary Key a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table. The Primary Key can't be a duplicate meaning 
	the same value can't appear more than once in the table. A table cannot have more than one primary key. Primary key field cannot be null; 
	value in a primary key column can never be modified or updated if any foreign key refers to that primary key; two rows can't have the same 
	primary key value. 
	Candidate Key 
	Alternate Key a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table. A table can have multiple choices for a 
	primary key but only one can be set as the primary key. All the keys which are not primary key are called an Alternate Key.
	Foreign Key 
	Compound Key 
	Composite Key 
	Surrogate Key 
	SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.
	CREATE TABLE table_name (
		column1 datatype constraint,
		column2 datatype constraint,
		....
	);
	NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
	UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
	PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
	FOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table
	CHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition // CHECK (Age>=18)
	DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified // DEFAULT "Jon doe"
	INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly // 

DDL, DML, DCL understanding
	DDL: A data definition or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, 
	especially database schemas. DDL statements create and modify database objects such as tables, indexes, and users. Common DDL statements are 
	CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.
	DML: A data manipulation language (DML) is a computer programming language used for adding (inserting), deleting, and modifying (updating) data 
	in a database. A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the 
	language. Read-only selecting of data is sometimes distinguished as being part of a separate data query language (DQL), but it is closely 
	related and sometimes also considered a component of a DML; some operators may perform both selecting (reading) and writing.
	DCL: 

SQL data types 
	

SQL operators, functions
	

Data manipulation (insert, update, delete)
	

Retrieving data (simple select statement)
	

Joins understanding
