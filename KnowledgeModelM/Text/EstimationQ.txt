6. Estimating in Agile
	
6.1. Estimating Size with Story Points
	Many agile teams, have transitioned to story points. Story points rate the relative effort of work in a Fibonacci-like format: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100. It may 
	sound counter-intuitive, but that abstraction is actually helpful because it pushes the team to make tougher decisions around the difficulty of work. Here are few reasons to 
	use story points:
	Dates don’t account for the non-project related work that inevitably creeps into our days: emails, meetings, and interviews that a team member may be involved in.
	Dates have an emotional attachment to them. Relative estimation removes the emotional attachment.
	Each team will estimate work on a slightly different scale, which means their velocity (measured in points) will naturally be different. This, in turn, makes it impossible to 
	play politics using velocity as a weapon.
	Once you agree on the relative effort of each story point value, you can assign points quickly without much debate. 
	Story points reward team members for solving problems based on difficulty, not time spent. This keeps team members focused on shipping value, not spending time. 

6.2. Velocity (simple explanation)
	The total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in user story points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of 
	historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.

6.3. Planning Poker, When to PLay
	Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of development goals in software 
	development. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and 
	the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for 
	subsequent estimates.
