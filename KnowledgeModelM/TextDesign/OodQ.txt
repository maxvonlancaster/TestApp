1. Abstraction
	Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding 
	unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without 
	understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.
	Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine in your 
	kitchen, you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a 
	specific operation. But you don’t need to understand how this method is implemented and which kinds of actions it has to perform to 
	create the expected result.
	In object-oriented programming theory, abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract "actors" that can 
	perform work, report on and change their state, and "communicate" with other objects in the system. 

2. Encapsulation
	Bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components. 
	Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct 
	access to them. Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class (so-called "getters" and "setters") to access the values, 
	and other client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.
	A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
	Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# 
	supports the following access specifiers − Public Private Protected Internal Protected internal
	Abstraction and encapsulation are related features in object oriented programming. Abstraction allows making relevant information visible 
	and encapsulation enables a programmer to implement the desired level of abstraction.
	Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and using C# Properties in the class to set and get 
	the values of variables.

5. Polymorphism
	Provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types. 
	Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically 
	via a virtual function). This is known respectively as static dispatch and dynamic dispatch.
	At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places such as method parameters and collections or arrays. 
	When this occurs, the object's declared type is no longer identical to its run-time type.
	Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and 
	implementation. At run-time, when client code calls the method, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object, and invokes that override of 
	the virtual method. Thus in your source code you can call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of the method to be 
	executed.
	Virtual methods enable you to work with groups of related objects in a uniform way. For example, suppose you have a drawing application that 
	enables a user to create various kinds of shapes on a drawing surface. You do not know at compile time which specific types of shapes the 
	user will create. However, the application has to keep track of all the various types of shapes that are created, and it has to update them in 
	response to user mouse actions. You can use polymorphism to solve this problem in two basic steps: 
	Create a class hierarchy in which each specific shape class derives from a common base class.
	Use a virtual method to invoke the appropriate method on any derived class through a single call to the base class method.
