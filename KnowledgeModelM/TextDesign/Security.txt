Information security concepts:

CIA Triad
	CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
	Confidentiality -> It's crucial in today's world for people to protect their sensitive, private information from unauthorized access.
	Integrity -> designed to protect data from deletion or modification from any unauthorized party, and it ensures that when an authorized person 
	makes a change that should not have been made the damage can be reversed
	Availability -> Authentication mechanisms, access channels and systems all have to work properly for the information they protect and ensure 
	it's available when it is needed.
