Information security concepts:

CIA Triad
	CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
	Confidentiality -> It's crucial in today's world for people to protect their sensitive, private information from unauthorized access.
	Integrity -> designed to protect data from deletion or modification from any unauthorized party, and it ensures that when an authorized person 
	makes a change that should not have been made the damage can be reversed
	Availability -> Authentication mechanisms, access channels and systems all have to work properly for the information they protect and ensure 
	it's available when it is needed.


Authentication/Authorization concepts
	Authentication is about validating your credentials such as Username/User ID and password to verify your identity. The system then checks 
	whether you are what you say you are using your credentials. Whether in public or private networks, the system authenticates the user identity 
	through login passwords. Usually authentication is done by a username and password, although there are other various ways to be authenticated.
	methods: Login form; Http; X.509 certification; custom
	Authorization occurs after your identity is successfully authenticated by the system, which therefore gives you full access to resources such 
	as information, files, databases, funds, etc. However authorization verifies your rights to grant you access to resources only after determining 
	your ability to access the system and up to what extent. In other words, authorization is the process to determine whether the authenticated 
	user has access to the particular resources. A good example of this is, once verifying and confirming employee ID and passwords through 
	authentication, the next step would be determining which employee has access to which floor and that is done through authorization.
	methods: access controls for URLs, secure methods and objects, Access control lists (ACLs)



Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	An access-control list (ACL), with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which 
	users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a typical 
	ACL specifies a subject and an operation. For instance, if a file object has an ACL that contains (Alice: read,write; Bob: read),
