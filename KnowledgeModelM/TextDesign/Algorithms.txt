1. Algorithms complexity (understanding, big O notation, complexity of common algorithms)
	In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. 
	Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary 
	operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the 
	algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.
	

2. Array sorting methods(bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort)
	

3. Tree structure(construction, traversal)
	

4. Binary search algorithm
	

5. Hash table(creating, collisions)
	

6. Stack, queue, linked list(construction, understanding, usage)
